Repo of all projects and other misc things done for the course

## Index
### Year 1
#### Intro Mechatronica
- [Arduino Project](/Year%201/Mechatronica/Arduino/) - First project in the course, basic arduino project that runs on Tinkercad

#### Programming
- [Lazy C Compiler](/Year%201/Programming/lcc.sh) - As the name suggests its just a script for compiling C with some QOL things because I'm too lazy to have to run the compiler over and over again.
- [NIM Style Coin Game](/Year%201/Programming/First%20Sem%20Project) - First Semester Project based on a variation of the classic NIM coin game.
